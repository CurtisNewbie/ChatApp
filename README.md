# ChatApp

A simple chat app that is powered by Quarkus and Angular. I am building this app to learn WebSocket.

## Use Guide

Download the latest build in RELEASE, which is a bundled verion that contains both the Quarkus Backend and the Angular Frontend. Run the executable as follows:

    java -jar chatapp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar

If you are using Linux OS, you can ./chatapp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runnerwnload the native build and use it as follows:

    ./chatapp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner

Be aware that you may need to change the permission of native build as follows:

    chmod +x chatapp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner

## Demo
